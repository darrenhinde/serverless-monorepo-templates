# Architecture Overview of Our SST v3 Project

This guide outlines the high-level architecture of our SST (Serverless Stack) v3 project. We'll break down the different components and explain how they interact with each other.

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)

Our frontend is built using Next.js, providing a robust and performant user interface.

- **Location**: `packages/dashboard`
- **Key Features**:
  - Server-side rendering
  - API routes for backend communication
  - Integration with tRPC for type-safe API calls

### 2. API Layer (tRPC)

We use tRPC to create a type-safe API layer between our frontend and backend.

- **Location**: `packages/core/src/trpc`
- **Key Features**:
  - Type-safe API endpoints
  - Automatic API documentation
  - Seamless integration with React hooks

### 3. Backend Services

Our backend services handle business logic and data processing.

- **Location**: `packages/core/src`
- **Key Components**:
  - Queries: `packages/core/src/queries`
  - Mutations: `packages/core/src/mutations`
  - Database entities: `packages/core/src/database/entities`

### 4. Database (DynamoDB)

We use Amazon DynamoDB as our primary database.

- **Configuration**: `infra/dynamo.ts`
- **Key Features**:
  - Serverless NoSQL database
  - Scalable and high-performance
  - Integrated with ElectroDB for improved data modeling

### 5. File Storage (S3)

Amazon S3 is used for storing and serving static files and assets.

- **Configuration**: Defined in SST stack
- **Usage**: Storing user uploads, static assets, etc.

### 6. Authentication (Cognito)

We use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization.

- **Configuration**: Defined in SST stack
- **Integration**: Used across the application for secure access

### 7. SST Infrastructure

SST manages our entire serverless infrastructure on AWS.

- **Configuration**: `sst.config.ts`
- **Key Features**:
  - Infrastructure as code
  - Local development environment
  - Easy deployment and management of AWS resources

## Architecture Breakdown

### Frontend to API Communication

1. The Next.js frontend makes API calls using tRPC client.
2. tRPC router in the backend receives these calls and directs them to appropriate handlers.

### API to Backend Services

1. tRPC procedures call corresponding query or mutation functions.
2. These functions interact with database entities or other AWS services as needed.

### Data Persistence

1. Backend services use ElectroDB entities to interact with DynamoDB.
2. File uploads are stored in S3 buckets.

### Authentication Flow

1. Users authenticate through Cognito.
2. JWT tokens are used to secure API calls and authorize access to resources.

## Key Considerations in Our Architecture

- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture allows automatic scaling based on demand.
- **Type Safety**: Use of TypeScript and tRPC ensures type safety across the stack.
- **Developer Experience**: SST provides a seamless local development experience.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model of serverless services optimizes costs.
- **Security**: Integrated authentication and authorization with Cognito.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for our application. As we continue to develop, we'll expand on these components and potentially introduce new services as needed.
