title: Plan of Architecture
description: This section provides an overview of the architecture plan.
---

In this section, we will delve into the architecture plan of our system. We will explore various diagrams and models that illustrate the structure and design of our application. These diagrams will help in understanding the relationships between different components and how they interact with each other.

### **4. Core Tables for Proof of Concept (POC)**

To get a **Proof of Concept (POC)** up and running efficiently, we'll focus on the most critical tables required for content creation, management, and AI automation. Here are the core tables you should prioritize for your POC:

1. **Users Table**: Essential for managing user information and access control.
2. **Ideas Table**: The starting point for storing content ideas, which will evolve into content plans and pieces.
3. **Content Plans Table**: Manages the structured content plans from ideas, enabling collaborative planning.
4. **Content Pieces Table**: Represents the actual content pieces to be created and published.
5. **AI Workflows Table**: Handles AI automation, which will help in generating and optimizing content.
6. **Resources Table**: Stores any associated assets (images, videos, documents) for the content.
7. **Analytics Table**: Tracks performance data for the published content pieces, providing insights for future content.

**Secondary Tables for Consideration in the POC**:
- **Comments Table**: If collaboration is a key feature of your POC, this will help with discussions and feedback.
- **Audit Logs Table**: Useful for tracking user actions, ensuring accountability from the start.
- **Version Control Table**: If versioning is critical during POC, include this to track changes to content.

### **Final Thoughts and Improvements**

**Improvements**:
- **Efficiency**: The schema is designed with efficiency in mind, using partition keys and sort keys to ensure fast querying, along with indexing on critical attributes like `tags`, `assignedTo`, and `status` to filter content quickly.
- **Flexibility**: The modular design of content plans, content pieces, and AI workflows allows you to easily extend functionality without needing significant changes to the underlying schema.
- **AI Automation**: By including a robust AI workflow mechanism, the system is prepared to scale with AI-driven content generation and optimization tasks.

This design should give you a strong foundation for building out a POC and eventually scaling the application with features like collaboration, AI automation, and content analytics. If you need further guidance or refinements, feel free to ask!
