To install and work on this SST v3 project, you need to have several prerequisites in place. Here's a list of all the essential pre-requisites for setting up and working on this project.

## Prerequisites

<Step>
<StepItem title="System Requirements">

  - **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js version 18.17 or higher installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
  - **pnpm:** The project uses `pnpm` commands. You can install it globally using npm: `npm install -g pnpm`.
  - **AWS Account:** You need an AWS account and the AWS CLI configured with your credentials.

To verify Node.js and pnpm installation, run:

  ```bash
  node -v
  pnpm -v
  ```

To verify AWS CLI configuration:

  ```bash
  aws configure list
  ```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Git">
You need to have Git installed to clone the repository. Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Code Editor">
You'll need a code editor to work on the project. Common options include:

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
  - Any other text editor you prefer.

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Required Knowledge">
- **SST:** Familiarity with SST (Serverless Stack) concepts and commands.
- **AWS:** Basic understanding of AWS services, especially Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
- **Next.js:** The project uses Next.js for frontend applications.
- **React:** Understanding of React's component structure and hooks.
- **TypeScript:** The project is written in TypeScript.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Familiarity with defining cloud resources programmatically.

</Step>

## Installation

<Step>
<StepItem title="Clone the Repository">
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
  cd your-project
  ```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Install Dependencies">
Use pnpm to install all the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file, including SST, AWS SDK, Next.js, and other project-specific packages.

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Starting the SST Development Environment">
Start the SST development environment by running:

  ```bash
  pnpm sst dev
  ```

The first time you run this, you'll be prompted to choose a stage name. Use a personal identifier (e.g., your name) to namespace your resources.

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Editing the Project">
  - **Infrastructure:** SST stacks are defined in the `infra/` directory.
  - **Lambda Functions:** AWS Lambda function handlers are in `packages/functions/`.
  - **Core Logic:** Business logic is centralized in `packages/core/`.
  - **Frontend:** Next.js applications are in `packages/landing-page/` and `packages/main-app/`.
  - **Schemas:** Zod schemas and TypeScript types are in `packages/schemas/`.

To make any changes to the project, open the files in your editor and modify them as needed.

<Note title="Live Lambda Development" type="info">
  SST's Live Lambda Development allows you to test your changes in real-time without redeploying your stack.
</Note>

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Building for Production">
To build the project for production:

  ```bash
  pnpm sst build
  ```

This will generate a production-ready build of your SST application.

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Deploying to AWS">
To deploy your SST application to AWS:

  ```bash
  pnpm sst deploy --stage prod
  ```

This will deploy your application to the specified stage in your AWS account.

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Optional
<Step>
<StepItem title="Setting Up CI/CD">
Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline using services like AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Local Testing">
You can use the `sst bind` command to test your Lambda functions locally:

</Step>


## Project structure

Your SST project is organized as follows:

```
project-root/
├── infra/                   # Infrastructure as code using SST
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                # Business logic and core functionalities
│   ├── functions/           # AWS Lambda function handlers
│   ├── landing-page/        # Landing page frontend (Next.js)
│   ├── main-app/            # Main application frontend (Next.js)
│   └── schemas/             # Zod schemas and TypeScript types
├── sst.config.ts            # SST configuration file
└── package.json             # Root package file
```


## Making your first change

Now that you've set up your project, let's make a simple change to the landing page:

1. Open `packages/landing-page/src/app/page.tsx`
2. Modify the welcome message
3. Save the file and observe the changes in your browser

SST's live lambda development will automatically update your application.
